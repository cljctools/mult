- should be possible
  - have multiple repl connections from an editor window
  - every repl tab has a list of connections (1 or more)
  - every tab has a (savable in settings) switch which runtime to prefer for cljc files - clj or cljs
  - when switching between files, tab switches namesapces if they are relevant to connections
  - these settings (sets of connections and preferred runtimes for cljc) are savable in workspace's .vsocde/settings
  - point is: one editor window should allow for 
    - seemless navigation between clj cljs cljc files 
    - evaluation of forms in their respective runtimes and connections
  - configuration file(s) should be part of the repo
    - saved, e.g. in .vscode/mult.edn
  - when opening repo in vscode, mult reads config(s) and sets up all connections and repl tabs 
    - * if user chooses 'set everything up as in config'
  - mult exposes a menu with all this options (in a tab, or dropdown after press)
    - you shouldn't have to know secret keybindings to get a list of available options(actions)
