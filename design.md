  - have multiple repl connections from an editor window
  - every repl tab has a list of connections (1 or more)
  - every tab has a (savable in settings) switch which runtime to prefer for cljc files - clj or cljs
  - when switching between files, tab switches namesapces if they are relevant to connections
  - these settings (sets of connections and preferred runtimes for cljc) are savable in workspace's .vsocde/settings
  - point is: one editor window should allow for seemless navigation between clj cljs cljc files and evaluation of forms in their respective runtimes and connections
